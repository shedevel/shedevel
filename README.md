- 👋 Hi, I’m @shedevel 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a really good developer and finding my sweet spot in tech!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend technologies such as Node.js, React and Next.js
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on projects, but anything to support equality and fairness would probably get me interested!
- 📫 You can reach me at codebyrd@outlook.com
