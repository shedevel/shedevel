- 👋 Hi, I’m @shedevel 
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things; data mining and data bias, fair and ethical algorithms, color theory, usability, readable code and coding for everyone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning frontend technologies such as Node.js, React and Next.js
- 💞️ I’m not currently looking to collaborate on projects, but anything to support equality and fairness would probably get me interested...
- 📫 You can reach me at codebyrd@outlook.com
